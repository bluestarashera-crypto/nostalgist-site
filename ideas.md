  **Design Movement**: Retro-Futurism / Cassette Futurism
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Analog Warmth in a Digital Void**: The interface should feel like a glowing CRT monitor in a dark room—warm, humming, and alive.
  2. **Tactile Interactions**: Buttons should feel like physical switches; inputs should feel like inserting a cartridge.
  3. **Data as Artifact**: Information isn't just text; it's a retrieved file, a decrypted log, or a scanned document.
  4. **Mystery & Discovery**: Don't reveal everything at once. Use "loading" sequences, redacted text, and hidden details to spark curiosity.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Deep, void-like blacks (`#0A0A0A`) to represent the "Substrate" and infinite space.
  - **Primary Accents**: Amber (`#FFC95E`) for "Lore/Memory" (warmth, history) and Cyan (`#6FE8FF`) for "System Focus" (active, digital).
  - **Secondary**: Neon Green (`#32FF5E`) strictly for "System Alive" status indicators, not for reading.
  - **Text**: Off-white (`#E0E0E0`) for readability, avoiding harsh pure white to reduce eye strain (CRT style).
  - **Reasoning**: This palette mimics the phosphorescent glow of early monitors while maintaining a modern, high-contrast look suitable for Web3 aesthetics.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **The Tri-Layer System**:
    1. **Anchor (Bottom)**: Fixed terminal status lines, raw code, and system diagnostics.
    2. **Flow (Middle)**: Asymmetric, constellation-like arrangement of content. Elements drift slightly.
    3. **Prism (Top)**: Glassmorphic overlays, modals, and high-fidelity interactive elements.
  - **Grid**: A faint, glowing grid that distorts slightly at the edges (curved screen effect).

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **CRT Scanlines**: A subtle, non-intrusive overlay to give texture.
  - **The "Underscore" Cursor**: A blinking block cursor (`_`) that leads all text animations.
  - **Glass Cards**: Frosted glass containers with sharp, glowing borders on hover.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Weighted Motion**: Interactions should have "mass." Opening a modal feels like hydraulic doors opening; typing feels like a mechanical keyboard.
  - **Decryption**: Content "decrypts" into view (random characters resolving into text) rather than just fading in.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Text streams in character-by-character (baud rate effect).
  - **Hover**: Elements glow and slightly "glitch" or shift chromatic aberration.
  - **Background**: Slow, drifting "starfield" or data particles connecting like constellations.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headers/Data**: `IBM Plex Mono` or `Space Mono` (Monospace) for that engineered, terminal look.
  - **Body/Reading**: `Inter` or `Manrope` (Sans-Serif) for legibility, but treated with tight tracking to feel technical.
  - **Hierarchy**: Large, bold monospace for titles; smaller, lighter sans-serif for descriptions.

  **Design Movement**: Brutalist Archival / Blueprint Aesthetic
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Structure over Decoration**: The design exposes its own grid and logic. Lines connect everything.
  2. **Raw Information**: Content is presented as raw data points, schematics, and technical specifications.
  3. **High Contrast**: Stark black and white with a single striking accent color (e.g., International Orange).
  4. **Permanence**: The interface feels etched, printed, or stamped—like a permanent record on a blockchain.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Paper white or very light grey (`#F5F5F5`) to mimic a physical blueprint or document.
  - **Ink**: Deep, ink black (`#111111`) for all primary elements.
  - **Accent**: International Orange (`#FF4F00`) for call-to-actions and critical alerts.
  - **Reasoning**: This departs from the "dark mode" norm of Web3/Gaming, positioning Nostalgist as a serious "Archive" or institution.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: A strict, visible grid system where every element occupies a defined cell.
  - **Borders**: Thick, definitive borders separating content areas.
  - **Asymmetry**: Content is balanced but not centered—often aligned to the bottom-left or top-right.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Barcode/QR Motifs**: Visual elements that suggest cataloging and tracking.
  - **Technical Rulers**: Axis lines and measurement markers along the edges.
  - **Stamps**: "CONFIDENTIAL", "ARCHIVED", or "APPROVED" stamps that appear over content.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap & Click**: Interactions are instant and rigid. No smooth easing; things snap into place.
  - **Hover Reveal**: Hovering over a "redacted" block reveals the text underneath.

  **Animation**:
  - **Drawing**: Lines draw themselves out to form the grid.
  - **Stamping**: Elements "stamp" onto the page with a slight scale bounce.
  - **Marquee**: Scrolling text for news tickers or status updates.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Primary**: `JetBrains Mono` or `Roboto Mono` for everything.
  - **Style**: Uppercase for headers, distinct weights to create hierarchy without changing font family.

  **Design Movement**: Ethereal Web3 / Liquid Chrome
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Fluidity**: The interface is in constant, slow motion—liquid, evolving, and organic.
  2. **Refraction**: Light plays a central role. Elements bend and distort the background like glass or water.
  3. **Preciousness**: The UI treats the content (memories/tokens) as precious gems or artifacts.
  4. **Minimalism**: Remove all non-essential elements. Let the content float in a void.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Deep gradient mesh of midnight blue, purple, and black.
  - **Elements**: Silver, chrome, and iridescent gradients.
  - **Light**: Soft, white glows to simulate lighting.
  - **Reasoning**: Focuses entirely on the "Prism" layer of the original spec, emphasizing the futuristic, high-value nature of the Archive.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Floating**: Elements have no visible container; they float in 3D space.
  - **Central Axis**: A strong central vertical axis, with elements spiraling around it.
  - **Depth**: Heavy use of Z-axis layering (parallax).

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Chrome Typography**: Text with metallic gradients and reflections.
  - **Orbs/Spheres**: Floating 3D abstract shapes that react to the mouse.
  - **Caustics**: Light patterns that look like water reflections.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Magnetic**: Cursor acts as a magnet, pulling elements towards it.
  - **Fluid Response**: Clicking creates ripples or waves in the background.

  **Animation**:
  - **Morphing**: Shapes slowly morph into others.
  - **Flow**: Background gradients flow like liquid.
  - **Shimmer**: Text and borders shimmer as if catching light.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: A high-contrast serif font like `Playfair Display` or a futuristic display font like `Syncopate`.
  - **Body**: Ultra-light `Inter` or `Helvetica Now`.
